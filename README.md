# `bitnami/photon-base`

## TL;DR

```dockerfile
FROM bitnami/photon-base
```

## About

The `bitnami/photon-base` image is a customized base image for use in Bitnami container images and is built on top of the optimized (Photon OS image)[https://hub.docker.com/r/library/photon/] from Docker Hub.

The `Dockerfile` installs [Nami](https://github.com/bitnami/nami) and includes a `bitnami-pkg` helper script to simplify downloading of Nami modules from the Bitnami package repositories. Additionally the `Dockerfile` installs [tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini)  and is used in the default [entrypoint](../../blob/master/rootfs/entrypoint.sh).

## Usage

Use like a regular base image.

The following example uses the `install_packages` helper script to install packages from the Photon repositories using `tdnf`.

```dockerfile
FROM bitnami/photon-base:3
RUN install_packages wget apr apr-util bzip2-libs glibc
CMD ["bash"]
```

## Configuration Parameters

The following tables lists the configurable parameters of the image.

|         Parameter         |                       Description                       |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `DISABLE_WELCOME_MESSAGE` | [Turn off the welcome text](#turn-off-the-welcome-text) |

### Turn off the welcome text

When a new container is launched, a welcome message is displayed as illustrated below:

```console
 *** Welcome to the apache image ***
 *** Brought to you by Bitnami ***
 *** More information: https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-apache ***
 *** Issues: https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-apache/issues ***
```

Adding `DISABLE_WELCOME_MESSAGE=1` to the container environment turns off this message.
